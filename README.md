A machine learning-based web application designed to predict agricultural crop yield based on key environmental and geographic factors. 
The system aims to support farmers, policymakers, and agricultural planners in making informed decisions to enhance productivity and sustainability.

**Overview**

This project leverages historical data and machine learning models to predict crop yield based on features like rainfall, temperature, soil type, 
fertilizer usage, and crop variety. It provides a user-friendly interface for input and returns predicted yield in real time.

** Features

1) Predicts crop yield based on user-provided environmental and farming parameters.
2) Utilizes machine learning models trained on real-world agricultural datasets.
3) Clean, intuitive interface for non-technical users (via web or CLI).
4) Visualizes feature importance and model predictions.
5) Scalable architecture for integrating additional crops and regions.

**Datasets and APIs**
   1) soil-quality-API : Soil | API - NARC
   2) Cereal and Cash Crops dataset : Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock Development
   3) real-time weather API- OpenWeatherMap
